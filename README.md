# Gif Application

This gif application was made with an input for searching, so the user can search for specific gifs. The API used in this project was the Giphy API, so we fetch the API, ang just get what we need, the url of the gif, the id and the title and then return the list of the gifs. Then we map the list of gifs in the component a set some styles.
